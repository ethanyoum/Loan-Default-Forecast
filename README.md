## Introduction

In the real estate market, housing loan trends are shaped by interest rate fluctuations, rising property prices, and evolving borrower risk profiles. Lenders must balance affordability with financial sustainability, ensuring loans remain accessible while minimizing default risks. Changing employment patterns, credit behaviors, and income stability require more refined risk assessments. Striking the right balance is crucial. Lenient terms can increase defaults, while strict requirements may exclude qualified buyers. To adapt, financial institutions leverage analytical strategies to optimize lending decisions, mitigate risks, and promote responsible home-ownership.
